        <p>
          I am a junior web developer who is seeking a full-time developer role.
          Currently I am working at a marketing agency as an IT / Help Desk
          Technician. My tools of choice are Javascript and HTML/CSS with React
          as my framework.
        </p>

        <p>
          I began learning how to code in 2015. Since then, I have completed a
          coding bootcamp, worked as a front-end intern at a marketing agency,
          and also had a small stint at a SaaS start-up. I continue to learn
          everyday, mostly at a local Starbucks while sipping on a hot caramel
          macchiatto.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thanks for stopping by!
          <br />
